# Voice-Activated Python Assistant

This is a basic voice-activated assistant built with Python. It can perform various tasks such as playing YouTube videos, telling the time, fetching Wikipedia summaries, and telling jokes, similar to a virtual assistant like Alexa.

## Features
- **Play songs**: Responds to commands like "Play [song name]" and plays the song on YouTube.
- **Tell the time**: Responds to "What's the time?" and provides the current time.
- **Search Wikipedia**: Provides a short summary for queries starting with "Who the heck is [name]".
- **Tell a joke**: Responds with a random joke when asked.
- **Fun responses**: Includes playful responses to certain questions like "Are you single?" or "Will you go on a date?"

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia pyjokes
```

### Usage
1. Clone or download the code to your local machine.
2. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python assistant.py
```

3. Use the microphone to give voice commands like:
   - "Play [song name]"
   - "What's the time?"
   - "Who the heck is [name]?"
   - "Tell me a joke."

The assistant will listen for commands and respond accordingly.

## Modules Used
- **SpeechRecognition**: For recognizing voice commands via microphone input.
- **pyttsx3**: For converting text to speech.
- **pywhatkit**: To search and play YouTube videos.
- **datetime**: To fetch the current time.
- **wikipedia**: To provide Wikipedia summaries.
- **pyjokes**: For fetching random jokes.

## Notes
- Make sure your microphone is working properly as the assistant relies on voice input.
- The assistant is triggered by saying "Alexa" in your command.
